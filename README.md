# Next.js 15: Missing return statement in page component
This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications where a missing `return` statement in a page component causes an unexpected error.  The `pages/about.js` file is missing a return statement, which will cause a runtime error during application execution.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about` in your browser. You'll see a runtime error.

## Solution
The solution involves adding a `return` statement in `pages/about.js` to return JSX or any valid React element, as shown in the `bugSolution.js` file.
